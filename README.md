A human interactive robot.

A robotics project which is able to play tic-tac-toe with human in real world. Mainly it is C language base project, but we also use openCV to implement. OpenCV library is used to get the inputs from board. I make an OCR in OpenCV which is used to find the cross (X) and ‘0’. Then the process is made where the input is given and considers the output.
